# GCFW_SC_Farming

Hi there. Just sharing some simple automation that I developed for SC farming. 

This is my first attempt to use AHK v2. To anyone who still uses v1, please stop. V1 has garbage syntax. V2 is a lot better.

## How to use

  1. Download ahk v2 from here: https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/

  2. Open this script with the AutoHotkeyU64.exe.
  
  3. Open the game, go to the World Map and make sure the W4 field as well as the corner to the right of it are visible on the screen:

  4. Good. Now, with the gemcraft window active, press F1 to start the automation, F2 to stop it and F3 to close the automation app. F4 and F5 are debugging functions. Use them for development.
  
  5. Enjoy :)

I use this automation on lvl 500 with about 30k starting mana and maxed out Seeker Sense, on 1980x1020 fullscreen.

It relies on images to understand what happens. Different resolution or even graphical drivers may render the game slightly differently resulting in images not being fount on your side. In that case, either make your own screenshots and replace my images or implement delay-based logic. I just don't like relying on delays.
